      <h2>Windows Theming</h2>
      <p>June 1st, 2022</p>
      <p>We all remember when Windows 8 made life harder for the working man. Simple menus were replaced with a whole start screen where legacy icons would sit lifeless inside a grey box. Nobody could seem to make start screen tiles work, functionally and aesthetically. I had to go the manual route with custom tiles and custom icons.</p>

      <p>For the entire lifespan of Windows 8, it never drew more than 15% of of the desktop OS marketshare. There were so few users that no artists would create good themes for it. Fed up with the lack of support after waiting years, I learned how to port my favorite Windows 7 theme to Windows 8, then repackaged the theme to redistribute as a port back on Deviantart.</p>

      <p>Note the custom taskbar icons.</p>
