      <p>Hi!</p>
      <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia doing second degree program. I have a background in Biochemistry and Chemistry. Cybersecurity is a area that particularly interests me and I hope learn more about it. I'm currently exploring uses of Computer Science in Chemistry.</p>
      <p>In my free time I'm into powerlifting and playing the guitar poorly.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h3>

        <h3>Conformer Counter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A python script that determines whether a methylcyclohexane is axial or equatorial.</li>
            <li>Will determine the ratio of conformers in the oddly specific scenario that you have thousands of methylcylcohexanes in a .gro file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Linear Progression Training Program</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Like 5x5 programs? Well don't let Mehdi know, because I've just stolen his training protocol</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Computational Chemistry Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A set of python scripts that convert files so that the poor undergrad doesn't have to!</li>
            <li>Can make turn multiple files into jobs for a given job setting.</li>
            <li>Will extract the data to .csv format for you.</li>
            <li>Gives you useful error messages.</li>
            <li>Frees you from relying on clunky Gaussian GUI.</li>
        </ul>
