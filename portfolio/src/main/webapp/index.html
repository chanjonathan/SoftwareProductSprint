      <p>Hi!</p>
      <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia doing second degree program. I have a background in Biochemistry and Chemistry. Cybersecurity is a area that particularly interests me and I hope learn more about it. I'm currently exploring uses of Computer Science in Chemistry.</p>
      <p>In my free time I'm into powerlifting and playing the guitar poorly.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h3>

        <h3>Conformer Counter</h3>
        <center><img src="images/Conformer.png" alt="Axial or Equatorial Conformers." width="450"/></center>

        <ul>
            <li>A python script that determines whether a methylcyclohexane is axial or equatorial.</li>
            <li>Will determine the ratio of conformers in the oddly specific scenario that you have thousands of methylcylcohexane molecules in a .gro file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Linear Progression Training Program</h3>
        <center><img src="images/LPTP.png" alt="Program Menu" width="250" /></center>
        <ul>
            <li>Like 5x5 programs? Well don't let Mehdi know, because I've just stolen his training protocol.</li>
            <li>Save and load your progress and generate new workout plans..</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Computational Chemistry Tools</h3>
        <center><img src="images/Tools.PNG" alt="CLI Interface" width="400" /></center>
        <ul>
            <li>A set of python scripts that convert files so that the poor undergrad doesn't have to!</li>
            <li>Can turn multiple files into jobs for a given job setting.</li>
            <li>Will extract the data to .csv format for you.</li>
            <li>Gives you useful error messages.</li>
            <li>Frees you from relying on clunky Gaussian GUI.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>The British Columbian wilderness has scenery that is perfect for photography. We have tall trees, lakes, and mountains; everything that you would want in an ideal landscape.</p>
